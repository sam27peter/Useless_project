# KOCHU MEENUM, PERIYA TROUBLUM üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: SPARKLES


### Team Members

### Project Description
PULIKARAN STAR
An interactive AI-powered virtual pet super duper fish that lives in a digital tank on your desktop. It reacts to your presence using computer vision, expressing complex emotions like hunger, fear, and even sass. It can be fed, scared, taunted, and commanded to perform a spectacular dance routine like Nagavali.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The profound existential loneliness of the common pet fish is a silent crisis plaguing households everywhere. They swim in endless, monotonous circles, their tiny fish brains devoid of purpose or personality. Furthermore, potential fish owners are burdened by the tedious, soul-crushing tasks of cleaning tanks and remembering to feed their aquatic wards.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We present a revolutionary digital habitat that liberates fish from their aquatic prisons and owners from their responsibilities. Our AI fish isn't just surviving; it's living. It experiences hunger, fear, joy (when dancing), and even develops a sassy attitude, taunting its human overlord via text-to-speech. It's all the personality of a pet with none of the wet, smelly cleanup.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
-Languages used: Python
-Frameworks used: Pygame
-Libraries used: OpenCV-Python, NumPy, MediaPipe, gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
-Tools used: Visual Studio Code, Command Prompt/Terminal


For Hardware:
- List main components: A standard PC (Windows/macOS/Linux), an integrated or external webcam.
-	List specifications: A dual-core processor and 4GB RAM should be sufficient.
-	List tools required: Just your hands for the hand-tracking interaction!


### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
Bash
pip install pygame opencv-python numpy mediapipe gTTS


# RunBash
python fish_tank_simulator.py

## Team Contributions
-	SAM PETER: Core AI behavior programming (seeking, fleeing, wandering), state machine implementation (dancing, spinning), and integrating the MediaPipe hand tracking module.
-	RIYA ROSE ROY: Game loop setup with Pygame, asset creation and integration (graphics, sound), UI/UX design (hunger bar, text bubbles), and implementing the gTTS text-to-speech feature.
